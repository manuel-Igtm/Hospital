# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT EMAIL].

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

## Additional Guidelines for Healthcare Projects

Given the sensitive nature of healthcare data and the potential impact of this software:

### Professional Conduct

* **Patient Privacy**: Never discuss, share, or use real patient data in issues, PRs, or discussions
* **Security First**: Report security vulnerabilities privately and responsibly
* **Quality Focus**: Recognize that code quality directly impacts patient safety and care
* **Regulatory Awareness**: Respect healthcare regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.) in all discussions

### Technical Discussions

* **Evidence-Based**: Support technical arguments with data, benchmarks, or citations
* **Constructive Criticism**: Focus on code and ideas, not people
* **Learning Environment**: Remember that healthcare IT is complex; help others learn
* **Documentation**: Clear documentation saves lives (and debug time)
